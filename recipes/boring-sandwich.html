    <h1>Boring Sandwich</h1>
    <img src="../images/sandwich.jpeg" alt="a boring looking sandwich">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is exactly what it sounds like. It's a sandwich, but not a very fun one considering its limited textures and flavors. However, it nutritionally has most of what you need and you're unlikely to be missing the ingredients called for, making it a pretty convenient choice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of bread of your choice</li>
        <li>Lunch meat of your choice. Probably ham, turkey, or roast beef</li>
        <li>1-2 slices of cheese, such as American or provolone</li>
        <li>A condiment such as mustard or mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay out the slices of bread</li>
        <li>On one of the slices, layer as much of the lunch meat as you'd like</li>
        <li>On top of the meat, add your cheese slice(s)</li>
        <li>On the plain slice of bread, spread your condiment of choice</li>
        <li>Place the bread with your condiment on top of the meat and cheese</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
